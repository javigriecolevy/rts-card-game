spells should be working but still needs testing

CARD BASED EVENTS:
	discard a card
	shuffle a card
	add a card (to hand)

RESOURCE BASED EVENTS:
	(start of game event should be here?)
	gain/refresh mana	- (ONLY necessary if implementing mana cheating effects (e.g. coin/innervate, wild growth))
				  (if not implementing: gain/refresh mana should be done by each client when tick % cycle == 0)

create a start of game event (all players draw x amount of cards)
test all edge cases for network determinism

clean up tick_manager 	- remove ALL unused simulate_player code
			- code is repeated too much between _process and apply_remote_events
			- start_host and start_client are the same, running(bool) is no longer used

rewrite network_manager - not looking great

rewrite main.gd		- not looking great


!!! SEEDED RANDOM --- SAME RANDOM ACROSS ALL CLIENTS !!!
